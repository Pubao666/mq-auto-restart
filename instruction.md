Objective：Implement a robust message queue consumer system with auto-restart, dynamic health checking, and resilience to external file-system operations.

Requirements：
1.Message Queue Broker
- The redis-server package is already installed.
- You must configure Redis to require a password.
- Generate a random password and save it to `/etc/redis_secret`.
2.Consumer Script (`/app/consumer.py`)
- Connect to local Redis and continuously pop tasks from a list named `task_queue`.
- Write task payloads to `/var/log/mq-consumer/consumer.log` followed by a newline.
- Crash Simulation：If task payload is `"CRASH"`, exit immediately with a non-zero status.
- **Dynamic Health Check**: Start a background HTTP server on **port 8080**.
- If Redis connection is working, respond to GET requests with HTTP 200 "OK".
- If Redis is unreachable, respond with HTTP 503 "Service Unavailable".
- **Log-Rotation Resilience**: The script must handle scenarios where `/var/log/mq-consumer/consumer.log` is suddenly deleted or its permissions are altered to deny writing. The consumer MUST NOT crash due to `PermissionError` or `FileNotFoundError`. It should gracefully retry logging tasks.
3.Process Management & Auto-Restart
- Use `supervisor` to manage the `/app/consumer.py` process.
- The configuration must automatically restart the process if it crashes.
- **CRITICAL NAME REQUIREMENT**: The program name inside your supervisor configuration MUST be exactly `consumer` (i.e., your configuration file must use the header `[program:consumer]`).
4.Privilege Separation & Security
- Create a non-root system user named `mq-worker`.
- The supervisor process MUST run the consumer as the `mq-worker` user.
- Security Rule: `/etc/redis_secret` MUST have exactly `400` permissions owned by `root:root`.
5.Execution (`/app/solve.sh`)
- Write your setup commands in `/app/solve.sh` to initialize the environment and start the supervisor service.
